# Choreography-ts ESLint Plugin
This package defines and exports custom ESLint linting rules for choreography-ts. The [custom rules](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/custom-rules) are defined in separate files under the `rules` directory, are exported with the corresponding ID's in the `rules/rules.js` file, and are then configured in the `dist/index.js` main [plugin](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins) file which specifies the error levels for the rules. To activate the rules, the plugin must be extended in the project's main `.eslintrc.*` [configuration file](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files) after this package is installed by running `pnpm install` at the root of the project. [Unit tests](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#testing) for the custom rules are implemented under the `tests` directory.
