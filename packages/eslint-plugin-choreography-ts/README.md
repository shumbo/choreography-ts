# Choreography-ts ESLint Plugin
This package defines and exports custom typescript ESLint linting rules for choreography-ts. The [custom rules](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/custom-rules) are defined in separate files under the `rules` directory using the [`typescript-eslint` library](https://typescript-eslint.io/developers/custom-rules). They are exported with the corresponding ID's and error levels under the `base` config in the `src/index.ts` main [plugin](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins) file. To activate the rules in any package, the plugin's `base` configuration must be extended in the `.eslintrc.*` [configuration file](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files) as `"@choreography-ts/choreography-ts/base"` after this package is installed by running `pnpm install @choreography-ts/eslint-plugin-choreography-ts` in the package directory. [Unit tests](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/rule-tester) for the custom rules are implemented under the `tests` directory.
