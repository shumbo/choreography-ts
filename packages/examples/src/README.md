# Examples

This folder contains example implementations of choreographic programs. Use `tsx` to execute examples (e.g., `pnpm tsx hello-world/hello-world`). You can also invoke `pnpm test` to test everything at once using the Vitest framework, which will run the `<example>.test.ts` unit test files.
